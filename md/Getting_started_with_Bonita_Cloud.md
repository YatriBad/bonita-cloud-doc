# Getting started with Bonita Cloud

With Bonita Cloud starting a new project has never been easier:

2. Download the Bonita Studio in your customer Portal ([Request a download](https://customer.bonitasoft.com/download/request)).

3. Develop your application within the studio ([Getting started](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/7.10/_getting-started-tutorial)).

With Bonita Cloud no need to install any runtime, they're already available in our cloud.

4. Configure your [Bonita Cloud Continuous Delivery platform](Continuous_Delivery_Configuring_your_Continuous_Delivery_Platform.md).

5. Use Bonita Cloud Continuous Delivery platform to build and deploy your application to the Integration or Pre-production runtimes ([Building and deploying to Bonita Cloud](Continuous_Delivery_Build_and_deploy.md)).


   ::: info 
   We recommand to use the non-production runtime as follows:
   * Integration: for tests by development team with test data 
   * Pre-production: for tests by the final or test users with production-like data.
   :::

6. Validate the application.

7. Deploy to production with the Bonita Cloud Continuous Delivery platform.
