# Connecting Bonita Cloud to your VPN

To connect your private network to Bonita Cloud, you can request for a site-to-site VPN connection.

It will secure the access your applications in Bonita Cloud (only the users connected to VPN will be able to access them) and it will also allow Bonita to interact with your other systems.

Bonita Cloud supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections.

## Failover
Two tunnels between VPN gateways can be configured to guarantee the secure connection between your network and Bonita Cloud.

## Incoming Traffic
By default, Bonita Cloud will allow connection from the public internet and the VPN. 

If needed, only the traffic coming from the VPN can be allowed. In this case, only the user connected to the VPN will be able to access your applications

## Impacts on the availability
Bonitasoft will guarantee the availability of the VPN gateway on the Bonita Cloud side. However, Bonitasoft is not responsible for issues on the customer side of the VPN (unreachable data for Bonita or impossibility for the customerâ€™s user to connect to the VPN).
