= Connecting Bonita Cloud to your VPN

To connect Bonita Cloud to your private network, you can request for a site-to-site VPN connection.

It will allow Bonita to interact with your other systems not exposed on internet (xref:LDAPConfiguration.adoc[LDAP] server...).

Bonita Cloud supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections.

== Failover

Two tunnels between VPN gateways can be configured to guarantee the secure connection between your network and Bonita Cloud.

== Incoming Traffic

Bonita Cloud will still allow connections from the public internet.

== Outgoing Traffic

Bonita Cloud will still allow connections towards the public internet but will also be capable to route securely connection towards your private network.

NOTE: This private communication is still subject to the firewall rules you have in place.

== Impacts on the availability

Bonitasoft will guarantee the availability of the VPN gateway on the Bonita Cloud side. However, Bonitasoft is not responsible for issues on the customer side of the VPN (unreachable data for Bonita or impossibility for the customer's user to connect to the VPN).

== Requesting a VPN Integration

To request a VPN connection with Bonita Cloud, create a new case on the Customer Service Center. Select _Professional Services_ as the type of request and make sure to provide the following information in your case:
