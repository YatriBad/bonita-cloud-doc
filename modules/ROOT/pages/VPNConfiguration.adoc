= Connecting Bonita Cloud to your VPN

To connect Bonita Cloud to your private network, you can request for a site-to-site VPN connection.

It will allow Bonita environments to interact with your internal information systems not exposed on the Internet (xref:LDAPConfiguration.adoc[LDAP] server...).

Bonita Cloud supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections.

== Failover

Two tunnels between VPN gateways can be configured to guarantee the secure connection between your network and Bonita Cloud.

== Incoming Traffic (from Bonita Cloud POV)

To ensure a versatile connectivity from anywhere, Bonita Cloud will continue to allow connections from public internet. This is done through a secured HTTPS link (supporting TLS 1.3).

== Outgoing Traffic (from Bonita Cloud POV)

Bonita Cloud will be able to securely connect to your internal resources which are not exposed on the Internet.
Bonita Cloud VPN is designed a way that only process connectors can reach your private resources. This means that Bonita Cloud users' trafic will not be embeded inside VPN connection.

NOTE: This private communication is still subject to the firewall rules you have in place.

== Impacts on the availability

Bonitasoft will guarantee the availability of the VPN gateway on the Bonita Cloud side. However, Bonitasoft is not responsible for issues on the customer side of the VPN (unreachable data for Bonita or impossibility for the customer's user to connect to the VPN).
